[Ruby for Good](www.rubyforgood.org) has teamed up with [reseachers at the Smithsonian Insitute working on red pandas](http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/AsiaTrail/RedPanda/default.cfm).

These reseachers use video data to record the behavior of the red pandas.  The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/science/red-pandas-are-adorable-and-in-trouble.html?_r=0) has an example of one our videos. Currently, humans must annotate the videos to find the red pandas in video.

Ruby for Good's red panda detector will help researchers identify red pandas in their video data and better understand research questions surrounding red panda conservation.
